    "## Happy Looping\n",
    "Programmers are lazy. They don't want to do things again and again. So they invented loops. After the boring basics, we'll now get to the fun stuff. Things that make programmers happy -- and journalists, too. For Loops are used to loop through a list of things. It basically says, \"for each item in my list, do something to each item\".\n",

    "- Given a list of restaurant reviews, what percentage are above 4 stars?\n",
    "- Given a list of movie ratings, which got the worst score?\n",
    "- Given a list of budget items, what is the total budget for cleaning supplies?\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: To be perfectly honest, there are a lot of other ways of doing these problems besides for loops, and most all of them are actually better! This is a good way to think through it for beginning Python students, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have three steps to any sort of problem that involves loops or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Initial Condition: You need to start somewhere. For example: If I’m counting dogs, how many dogs do I know about before I even start counting? Zero, probably.\n",
    "2. The Conditional: Every time you go through the loop, you probably test something to see if you should make a change. If I’m counting pit bulls, it might be something like is this a pit bull? If it is, let’s do something.\n",
    "3. The Change: If the conditional is true, I need to do something. Maybe it’s since this was a pit bull, let’s incrementing the pit_bulls counter."
