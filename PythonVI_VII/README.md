# Welcome to the pandas workshop at EIJC 2018!

This workshop is also known as PythonVI and PythonVII. These are the materials we used in both.

We worked with tender data that you can download from the link below. We worked through some questions and merged in CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) data that can be found in the data dictionary. [The resulting notebook](EIJC Pandas 2018.ipynb) has all the steps we went through.
